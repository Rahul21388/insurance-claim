# Fraudulent Claim Detection 🕵️‍♂️📊

Welcome to the **Fraudulent Claim Detection** project. This repository contains all resources and code used to develop a machine learning model that identifies potentially fraudulent insurance claims using historical data.

## 🧠 Business Objective

**Global Insure** seeks to streamline its claims verification process by leveraging data-driven approaches to detect fraud early and accurately. Currently, manual fraud detection involves reviewing documents, conducting calls and background checks—these methods are time-consuming, prone to human error, and inefficient.

This project aims to build a **predictive model** that classifies incoming insurance claims as **fraudulent or legitimate**. The model will use various data features including:

- Customer demographics (age, occupation, hobbies)
- Policy information (coverage limits, premiums)
- Incident specifics (type, severity, location)
- Claim details (claim amount, damage type)
- Vehicle information (make, model, year)
- Historical fraud labels (fraud/not fraud)

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Detect patterns and key indicators that distinguish fraudulent claims from genuine ones.
- Develop a supervised classification model that predicts the likelihood of fraud for each new claim.
